As the most popular resilience method, I implemented an in-memory checkpoint/restart system for OpenSHMEM. In this system, processes (the parallel entities) can request for their data to be saved in memory and when a failure happens, the last saved data will be reloaded in all the processes. If a process is dead, it will be replaced with a new process.

						<h3>Journalism</h3>
						<p>
							Starting from the end of high school, reading and thinking about women's right became an enormous interest of mine. After entering m undergraduate university, I found the oppurtunity to join groups with focus on women's rights and studies, which soon became my biggest extracurricular activity. Living in one of countries with the least gender equality, I made it my mission to increase my own knowledge, awareness, and movements inside the university towards a better place for female students. Due to large effects of politics in Iran on women's rights, I also became interested in the politics and everyday news in Iran and the World. Some of my more significant activities were:
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Women Rights and Studies Groups:</span> 
							During my undergraduate years 2010-2015, I joined three different women’s rights and studies groups. During weekly or bi-weekly meetings, we read and discussed different articles and books about women's rights and issues, and the politics and religous beliefs around them. We celebrated Women's International Day (not observed in Iran), and updated the clubs' boards frequently.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Digari Journal</span> <span class="persian font-weight-bold">(گاهنامه‌ی دیگری):</span>
							 The journal's name, meaning "The Other", was inspired by de Beauvoir’s quote in The Second Sex, “He is the Subject, he is the Absolute – she is the Other.” I was the chief editor of this cultural-social journal, and we wrote articles with focus on women and minorities' problems in Iran. My articles mostly covered violence against women and hijab enforcement inside the university which had intensified during those years.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Khabarname Weekly Journal</span> <span class="persian font-weight-bold">(هفته‌نامه‌ی خبرنامه):</span> Around 2015, I started to write for the women’s right section of another weekly journal, called “Khabarname”, or “News Letter”. Aside from a special article for International Women’s Day, my most significant work was one criticizing the government’s lack of attention to women’s problems. This journal was the most popular journal at the time in the university, selling a few hundred copies each week.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> RAA: </span>
							After coming to US, in 2018 a friend of mine started an online radio for Persian speaking immigrants of North America, called <a href="https://raa.media/">RAA</a>. Most of this radio’s programs were produced by Iranian students in US, and I started a group for a newscasting program. We, a group of four, gathered the world’s (mostly Iran and US) news from multiple sources, picked up to 15 subjects and wrote short reports on them, recorded them three times a week, edited the records for higher quality and less noise, and broadcasted them on the radio’s website and mobile applications. In less than a year, the radio gained more than a hundred listeners worldwide.
						</p>

						<h3>Mountain Climbing, Camping, and Traveling</h3>
						<p>
							Traveling is a big passion of mine. I joined the Mountain Climbing Club in Sharif University of Technology and together we traveled to the lesser known attractions of Iran. I also attended the Mountain Climbing Workshop held by Iran Mountaineering and Sport Climbing Federation and received a certificate.
						</p>
						<p>
							Other than camping and spending time in nature, I love to travel and discover new places.
