					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I am an Iranian computer scientist living in U.S. I achieved my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, and my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Shaif University of Technology. My interests are algorithms and problem solving, parallel programming, web development, and anything creative. </p>

						<h3>M.Sc. in Computer Science, Stony Brook University</h3>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Thesis: Checkpoint/Restart Implementation for OpenSHMEM</span> - My thesis was focused on making OpenSHMEM, a PGAS parallel programming library, resilient towards failures. As the most popular resilience method, I implemented an in-memory checkpoint/restart system for OpenSHMEM. In this system, processes (the parallel entities) can request for their data to be saved in memory and when a failure happens, the last saved data will be reloaded in all the processes. If a process is dead, it will be replaced with a new process.
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Advisor: Prof. Barbara Chapman.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Relevant Coursework: </span>
							Algorithms, Parallel Programming Models, Fundamentals of Computer Networks, Artificial Intelligence, Theory of Database Systems, System Security.
						</p>
						
						<h3>B.Sc. in Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology</h3>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Thesis: Speech/Non-Speech Recognition</span> - In my thesis, I developed a program with MATLAB to detect speech or non-speech parts of audio files using SVM with linear kernel, and achieved up to 95\% accuracy. The test and train data was derived from 19 movies and labeled automatically using the subtitles.

							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Relevant Coursework: </span>
							Advanced Programming (Java), Data Structures and Algorithms, Web Development (Audited), 3D Computer Vision, Speech Processing, Fundamentals of Bioinformatics.
