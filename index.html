						<h3>M.Sc. in Computer Science, Stony Brook University</h3>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Thesis: Checkpoint/Restart Implementation for OpenSHMEM</span> - My thesis was focused on making <a href="http://openshmem.org/site/" target="_blank">OpenSHMEM</a>, a PGAS parallel programming library, resilient towards failures. As the most popular resilience method, I implemented an in-memory checkpoint/restart system for OpenSHMEM. In this system, processes (the parallel entities) can request for their data to be saved in memory and when a failure happens, the last saved data will be reloaded in all the processes. If a process is dead, it will be replaced with a new process.

					<h2>Other Projects and Research Experiences</h2>
					<div>
						<h3></h3>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold">Parallel Computing:</span>
							I joined the <a href="https://you.stonybrook.edu/exascallab/" target="_blank">Exascallab</a> group led by <a href="https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/people/_faculty/barbara-chapman.php" target="_blank">Prof. Barbara Chapman</a> in Jan 2017 and I have worked on High Performance Computing, especially Parallel Programming ever since. My main project has been around fault tolerance in <a href="http://openshmem.org/site/" target="_blank">OpenSHMEM</a> and <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/mpi/" target="_blank"></a> MPI. For more infor, see my <a href="#edu">education</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold">Web Application Firewall (WAF):</span>
							A project for System Security course (Fall 2016)- we implemented a WAF including multiple systems such as a packet analyzer, a URL parser, and train and test modes. The WAF was designed to stop XSS attacks and SQL injections on a Joomla weblog (using a vulnerable version). After arrival of a packet at the packet analyzer, the reuqested URL was parsed to detect the subparts of the URL and type of request. In training mode (when we suppose all requests are legitimate), we stored the URL subparts and the type of request made presented by a bit vector (e.g., if the request only consists of alpha-numerical characters) in nested hashtables. At the end of the training mode, all stored data was flushed to a file to be used during test mode as a white list. During test mode, the file was loaded back into hashtables and any packet with a request outside of the white list was dropped. I implemented the store and search process with hashtables in C.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold">Handwritten Digit Recognition:</span>
							A project for Machine Learning course (Spring 2016)- we compared the accuracy of different Machine Learning models (e.g. K-NN, K-means, and SVM) along with Image Processing methods (such as edge, line or corner detectors, Hough Transform, etc) to categorize pictures of low-resolution handwritten digits. We achieved up to 94% accuracy - programmed with MATLAB.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold">Graph Labeling and Factorization:</span>
							(Spring 2014 - Spring 2015) We studied graph labeling and chromatic number of a special group of graphs (forests), developed and proved new theories and tested some using C++ programming. This research was in collaboration with <a href="http://cs.ipm.ac.ir/" target="_blank">Graph Theory Group</a> of <a href="http://ipm.ir/" target="_blank">Institute for Research in Fundamental Science (IPM)</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold">GUI for Data Search:</span>
							(Spring 2014) - During internship for <a href="http://asr-gooyesh.com/en/" target="_blank">ASR Gooyesh Pardaz</a>, I implemented a GUI using Java Swing enabling the user to search for data with desired labels (e.g. length, male or female voices, year, etc) in text and speech dataset.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold">Automatic Language Detection:</span>
							A project for the graduate course Speech Processing (Spring 2014) - We developed a program to detect the language of speech files in English, French, and German, with MATLAB. We tried implementing different methods and I implemented the train and test parts using SVM method and achieved more than 90% accuracy.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold">Whole Transcriptome Assembly:</span>
							A project for the graduate course Fundamentals of Bioinformatics (Spring 2014) - We were given the sequences of rice genome (Oryza Sativa species), using the sequences of Harvard Gene Index, UTRdb, RAP, and some other databases, to analyze in order to increase the length of the sequences and decrease the error, programmed in C++.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold">Camera Calibration:</span>
							An individual project for 3D Computer Vision course (Spring 2014) - calibrating a camera using a set of pictures of the same object from different angles and different camera properties - programmed with MATLAB.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold">Games:</span>
							Two individual projects for Advanced Programming (Java) course (Fall 2011) - implemented Tetris and one board game, using Java Swing and Object Oriented Programming.

						</p>

						<h3>Other Skills</h3>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Teaching: I started teaching as early as 4th grade. Since high school, I have taught Mathematical and Computer Science subjects to younger students: from 2008 to 2013 I taught various subjects (including Graph Theory, Stable Marriage Algorithm, Induction, etc) in the annual <a href="http://karsooghmehregan.ir/" target="_blank">Mehregan mathematics workshops</a> held at <a href="http://www.nodet.net/" target="_blank">NODET</a> junior high schools through games and interactive courses. I also taught programming in C++ and algorithms to high school students preparing for National Olympiad in Informatics. During my undergraduate and graduate years I was a TA for multiple courses, such as Introduction to Programming (C and C++), Data Structures and Algorithms, Introduction to Computer Science (fundamentals and Python programming), Programming III (Java), and Introduction to Computer Networks.</li>
								<li>Event management: During 2007 to 2010 I was part of the organizers team for the <a href="http://karsooghmehregan.ir/" target="_blank">Mehregan mathematics workshops</a>. Held at multiple junior high schools in various cities, this workshop was the biggest mathematical event of all NODET junior high schools in Iran. In addition to partial roles in 3 workshops, such as exam designer and grader and teacher, I was in charge of the 9th Mehregan mathematics workshops (2009) and became the first under 18 manager of the events. For this event, we designed and organized two levels of entrance exams, graded them, and held a 3-day workshop in summer for the top 60 students. In this workshop for the first time, as part of my suggestions, we held daily group challenges with awards for the top three teams of each day's challenge, daily games, and a short trip to the historical monuments of Esfahan to teach about architecture and geometry in a more memorable and fun way. All of these events became part of the tradition of the workshops happening every year ever since. Managing a group of 15 teachers and organizers, multiple classes and events for 60 students, with few resources and only a budget of 120$, was my most memorable experience of event management. Since then I have participated in organizing other events such as staff of orientation for new university students, staff of 16th Asia Regional ICPC/ACM competition, or the publicity chair of <a href="https://you.stonybrook.edu/iwomp2017/" target="_blank">IWOMP and OpenMPCon 2017</a>.</li>

					<h2>Hobbies</h2>

						<h3>Journalism</h3>
						<p>
							Starting from the end of high school, reading and thinking about women's right became an enormous interest of mine. After entering my undergraduate university, I found the oppurtunity to join groups with focus on women's rights and studies, which soon became my biggest extracurricular activity. Living in one of countries with the least gender equality, I made it my mission to increase my own knowledge, awareness, and movements inside the university towards a better place for female students. Due to large effects of politics in Iran on gender issues, I also became interested in the politics and everyday local and global news. Some of my more significant activities were:
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Women's Rights and Studies Groups:</span> 
							During my undergraduate years 2010-2015, I joined three different women’s rights and studies groups. During weekly or bi-weekly meetings, we read and discussed different articles and books about women's rights and issues, and the politics and religous beliefs around them. We celebrated Women's International Day (not observed in Iran), and updated the clubs' boards frequently.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Digari Journal</span> <span class="persian font-weight-bold">(گاهنامه‌ی دیگری):</span>
							 The journal's name, meaning "The Other", was inspired by de Beauvoir’s quote in The Second Sex, “He is the Subject, he is the Absolute – she is the Other.” I was the chief editor of this cultural-social journal, and we wrote articles with focus on women and minorities' problems in Iran. My articles mostly covered violence against women and hijab enforcement inside the university which had intensified during those years.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> Khabarname Weekly Journal</span> <span class="persian font-weight-bold">(هفته‌نامه‌ی خبرنامه):</span> Around 2015, I started to write for the women’s right section of another weekly student journal, called “Khabarname”, or “News Letter”. Aside from a special article for International Women’s Day, my most significant work was one criticizing the government’s lack of attention to and work on women’s issues. This journal was the most popular journal at the time in the university, selling a few hundred copies each week.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="font-weight-bold"> RAA: </span>
							After coming to US, in 2018 a friend of mine started an online radio for Persian speaking immigrants of North America, called <a href="https://raa.media/">RAA</a>. Most of this radio’s programs were produced by Iranian students in US, and I started a group for a newscasting program. We, a group of four, gathered the world’s (mostly Iran and US) news from multiple sources, picked up to 15 subjects and wrote short reports on them, recorded them three times a week, edited the records for higher quality and less noise, and broadcasted them on the radio’s website and mobile applications. In less than a year, the radio gained more than a hundred listeners worldwide.
						</p>

						<h3>Mountain Climbing, Camping, and Traveling</h3>
						<p>
							Traveling is a big passion of mine. I joined the Mountain Climbing Club in Sharif University of Technology and together we traveled to the lesser known attractions of Iran. I also attended the Mountain Climbing Workshop held by Iran Mountaineering and Sport Climbing Federation and received a certificate.
						</p>
						<p>
							Other than camping and spending time in nature, I love to travel and discover new places.
